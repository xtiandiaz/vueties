# Vueties

A collection of beauties (beautiful components) created and maintained to be used and shared across several Vue3 apps as a submodule.

Usage examples:

1. [Ari](https://xtiandiaz.github.io/ari)
1. [Recetario](https://xtiandiaz.github.io/recetario)
1. [Lexi](https://xtiandiaz.github.io/lexi)

The collection includes:

- Buttons
- Bars
- Pads
- Basic Forms
- Modal views
- Basic transitions
- And [design tokens](https://xtiandiaz.github.io/lexi) (colors, iconography, typography, etc.) of my particular taste and preference.
- Probably more to come as needed...

You may have noticed, however, that they're not documented. Well, mainly because I don't expect to lure other devs. to use these vueties given the fact that there are many other reliable alternatives. In any case, feel free to fork and/or offer contribution.
